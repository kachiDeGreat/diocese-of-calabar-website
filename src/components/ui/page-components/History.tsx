              The Anglican Diocese of Calabar was established as a Missionary
              Diocese on 20 December 1990 by the Church of Nigeria (Anglican
              Communion), forming one of eight new dioceses created that year to
              accommodate the expanding Anglican community in southeastern
              Nigeria. This creation occurred amid the Church of Nigeria's
              broader late-20th-century diocesan proliferation, driven by the
              rapid post-colonial growth of Christianity in the Niger Delta
              region, where missionary activities had laid foundational roots
              since the mid-19th century. The diocese drew from earlier Anglican
              efforts, including the establishment of Holy Trinity Anglican
              Church in Calabar in 1911, which evolved from a
              multi-denominational congregation aligned with the Niger Delta
              Pastorate under the Church Missionary Society's influence.

              The Rt. Rev. W. G. Ekprikpo was appointed and consecrated as the
              first bishop of the Missionary Diocese of Calabar on 16 September
              1990, during a consecration service at St. Cyprian's Anglican
              Church in Port Harcourt. Ekprikpo, previously the Dean and sole
              Archdeacon of the Calabar Archdeaconry since 1987, played a
              pivotal role in the diocese's initial organization by establishing
              the Bishop's Court at 81 Calabar Road as its administrative
              headquarters.

              His tenure emphasized foundational missionary outreaches,
              inheriting parishes from the broader Niger Delta structures and
              initiating evangelistic expansions into northern Cross River State
              areas previously under other diocesan oversight. In its early
              years, the diocese grappled with significant infrastructural
              limitations, relying heavily on the enduring legacies of
              mid-19th-century Presbyterian missions in Calabar, initiated by
              Rev. Hope Masterton Waddell in 1846, which laid the foundations
              for Protestant Christianity among the Efik, later aligned with
              Anglican efforts through the Church Missionary Society's Niger
              Delta Pastorate. These challenges included sparse facilities and
              the need to consolidate scattered parishes into a cohesive
              structure, with a primary focus on evangelism among the local Efik
              and Ibibio ethnic groups predominant in Calabar and surrounding
              areas. Initial outreaches targeted communities such as Akampka,
              Ediba, Ugep, and Ofatura, marking the diocese's commitment to
              grassroots mission work despite resource constraints.

              Following its inauguration by Primate Joseph Abiodun Adetiloye,
              the diocese experienced rapid organizational growth, with the
              elevation of Holy Trinity Anglican Church to cathedral status and
              the formation of initial archdeaconries in Calabar, Ogoja, and
              Ikom during the 1990s. By the early 2000s, the diocese had
              expanded to include over 96 stations across 13 districts and
              numerous parishes, reflecting evangelical outreach to areas such
              as Akampka, Ediba, Ugep, Ofatura, and the Ogoja region inherited
              from the Diocese of Enugu. This growth was supported by quarterly
              clergy retreats, the establishment of a diocesan central office in
              2000, and strengthened lay organizations like the Men's Christian
              Fellowship and Women's Guild.

            <p className="h-p mt-2 mt-md-4">
              The diocese integrated into the Ecclesiastical Province of Niger
              Delta as part of the Church of Nigeria's reorganization into 14
              provinces around 2002, positioning Calabar as a foundational
              diocese within the newly formed province, which initially
              encompassed about 12 dioceses and has since grown to 18, focused
              on the Niger Delta's unique cultural and geographical needs. As a
              key entity in this provincial framework, Calabar contributed to
              broader regional coordination, with its bishop periodically
              assuming leadership roles such as membership in the provincial
              council to oversee evangelism and administration across riverine
              and upland territories.

            <h3 className="h-h3">Episcopal Succession</h3>
            <p className="h-p mt-3">
              The episcopal succession in the Anglican Diocese of Calabar
              follows the Church of Nigeria's established process, whereby a new
              bishop is elected by the Provincial Episcopal Synod of the
              relevant province (in this case, the Ecclesiastical Province of
              Niger Delta), with the election requiring ratification and
              approval by the Primate of the Church of Nigeria. This ensures
              alignment with the broader Anglican Communion's governance while
              addressing diocesan needs through synodal discernment. No interim
              administrators are recorded in the diocese's history following the
              founding in 1990.

              Rt. Rev. William G. Ekprikpo (1990–1999): The inaugural bishop,
              appointed on 16 September 1990 and consecrated later that year at
              St. Cyprian's Anglican Church in Port Harcourt; he served until
              retirement in 1999 after overseeing the initial establishment and
              expansion of the missionary diocese.

              consecrated in November 1999, enthroned shortly thereafter; he
              also held the dual role of Archbishop of the Ecclesiastical
              Province of Niger Delta from 2018 until his retirement at age 70
              in February 2021, during which the diocese saw significant growth
              in parishes and institutions.

              Rt. Rev. Prof. Nneoyi Onen Egbe (2021–present) was elected by the
              Provincial Episcopal Synod and enthroned on 17 July 2021 at the
              Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity, Calabar. Since his
              enthronement, he has promoted the integration of academic and
              theological disciplines, drawing on his professorship in
              radiography and his advanced degrees in physics and theology to
              bridge science and faith within diocesan training programs. From
              2021 onward, he has strengthened youth evangelism through
              mentorship initiatives, university fellowships, and worship
              leadership. This includes the establishment of praise bands at the
              University of Calabar’s Chapel of Redemption to enhance youth
              engagement in worship. Bishop Egbe is also a strong advocate for
              environmental justice in the oil-impacted Niger Delta,
              consistently calling for policy reforms to protect local
              communities from resource exploitation.
